# Tor Configuration
#
# To chain Privoxy and Tor, both running on the same system:
# forward-socks5   /               127.0.0.1:9050 .

# The public Tor network can't be used to reach your local network,
# if you need to access local servers you therefore might want
# to make some exceptions:
#
# forward         192.168.*.*/     .  
# forward         10.*.*.*/        .  
# forward         127.*.*.*/       .
#
# Unencrypted connections to systems in these address ranges will
# be as (un) secure as the local network is, but the alternative
# is that you can't reach the local network through Privoxy at
# all. Of course this may actually be desired and there is no
# reason to make these exceptions if you aren't sure you need them.
#
# If you also want to be able to reach servers in your local
# network by using their names, you will need additional exceptions
# that look like this:
#
#  forward           localhost/     .
